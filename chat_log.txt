User: I want to use AI to predict metabolic syndrome control in NCD patients. What kind of models should I use?

AI: That’s a relevant and important application. Since your target variable is binary (controlled vs uncontrolled metabolic syndrome), here are a few suitable models:

Logistic Regression (for interpretability)

Random Forest / XGBoost (for performance & feature importance)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (for capturing complex patterns)

Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) (to quantify uncertainty)

Do you want guidance on how to implement these in Python or compare their performance?

User: I already implemented ANN and BNN with variational inference. But I get different accuracy scores each time I run BNN. Is that normal?

AI: Yes, that’s expected with Bayesian models, especially those using variational inference. Because BNNs sample weights from a probability distribution, each run can yield slightly different results.

To stabilize your results:

Set a fixed random seed for reproducibility

Average predictions over multiple Monte Carlo samples

Train longer or adjust your KL divergence scale

Would you like a code example to implement prediction averaging?

User: Yes, that would be helpful.

AI: Here’s how you can average predictions using TensorFlow/Keras:
